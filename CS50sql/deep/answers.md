# From the Deep

In this problem, you'll write freeform responses to the questions provided in the specification.

## Random Partitioning

Dividing the data among 3 boats can improve accessibility and ensure a backup in case one boat loses data. However, this approach consumes unnecessary space. A more space-efficient solution would involve assigning each boat to its own time zone.

## Partitioning by Hour

Organizing the data into 3 sections based on time periods minimizes the required storage for each database. This method enhances efficiency, as each database operates only within its designated time frame.

## Partitioning by Hash Value

Using hash values speeds up database operations by focusing on smaller hash searches instead of entire date searches. Additionally, indexing can further accelerate searches. However, assigning consistent hash values to the same date can sometimes become complex if all hash values are provided.
